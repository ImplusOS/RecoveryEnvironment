# ImplusOS RecoveryEnvironment

A minimal init process used by the ImplusOS install media, built against
the same [API](https://github.com/ImplusOS/API) and
[I_libc](https://github.com/ImplusOS/I_libc) as the regular userland init.

This repository is a component of **[ImplusOS](https://github.com/ImplusOS)**,
a hobby operating system with a monolithic kernel, loadable driver modules,
a minimal freestanding C library, and a small graphical userland. It is not
meant to be built in isolation -- it is consumed as a checkout alongside
ImplusOS's other component repositories (see `Docs` for the full
architecture and `ImplusOS/Makefile` for how the pieces are wired together).

## Layout

## Build

target.
